# Assembly Learning

This repo is made up of a collection of assembly files that I am creating in order to learn and understand assembly

## Credits

The book listed below has been a great help to my understanding of low level Assembly and I highly recommend checking it out if you want to learn as well.

**Youtuber**

Also recommend watching [Low Level Learning](https://www.youtube.com/@LowLevelLearning) or LLL on youtube as they got me interested interested low level computing in the first place.

## Additional Info

You may also notice that I am using intel syntax while the book uses AT&T.

The reason for this is that my first assembly code was written while following a video from LLL.

I decided to stick with it as it makes me work a little harder to understand what the differences are between the two syntax styles and forces me to understand what is happening under the hood.
